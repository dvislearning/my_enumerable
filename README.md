# My_enumerable

### An exercise in working with blocks and procs from [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/advanced-building-blocks).  

This exercise re-creates different various methods from the Ruby Enumerable module. 

 Methods re-created are:

.each
.each_with_index
.select
.all
.any
.none
.count
.map
.inject
.map that takes a proc
.map that takes either a block, or proc, or both.  If both, both the proc and block will be passed.
